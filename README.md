### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Nice to meet you!

I am Huang Xu, you can also call me Harry that it is my first English name when I started to learn the language. Now I work as a software engineer in Hangzhou City, China.

My research interests are speech technique and some devops skill. I think the speech technique is one kind of mostly easy-to-land AI application and can make people's life difference.

ðŸš€ I use daily: Java Python
